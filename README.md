# Scripts
#### In this repo those scripts are pushed which I created and used in some of my tasks and may need in future too. These scripts are specific to my tasks so may need some customization for others.

## [Create Json File](https://github.com/tarun-bisht/Scripts/tree/master/create-json)
* This Script is used to create json file from two text files.</li>
* I have used this script to create json file for localization in my Laravel Project.
* Make sure that while creating text file two different keys are seperated with new line. ie.. In .txt file all different keys should be seperated with new line. 
1. Create Two Files in which one file is used as key and other is used as value.
2. Run the script and enter the path of files. first path entered will be treated as key while second file is treated as value.
3. Json file successfully created and it saves a lot of time.
For Localized json for laravel project.
* created a text file with all english words which are to be used.
* Using Google translate, translated all the words in desired language
* Run the Script and get my json file.
## [Prime Numbers](https://github.com/tarun-bisht/Scripts/tree/master/prime%20numbers)
This Script can check for Prime Numbers and find Prime Numbers between a Range given.</li>
