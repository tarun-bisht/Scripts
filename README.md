# Scripts
This Script is used to create json file from two text files.
I have used this script to create json file for localization in my Laravel Project.

###########################################################
<br>
Make sure that while creating text file two different keys are seperated with new line. ie.. In .txt file all different keys should be seperated with new line.

1-- Create Two Files in which one file is used as key and other is used as value.
2-- Run the script and enter the path of files. first path entered will be treated as key while second file is treated as value.
3-- Json file successfully created and it saves a lot of time.
